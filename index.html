<div class="intro">
<P> Hello,here I present some of my work . As I enjoy programming, during my free time I developed 
  several programs related to the <strong>Geomatics </strong>field as my first degree is in Geodesy Science
  and Topography. When I was a student, I had to use a calculator HP41CV where I helped my self by writing codes which where useful for calculations.
  As you know, a calculator is limited in a memory size and operation I jumped to a computer using Fortran language which is dedicated for enginering and science.
  Discovering the nice user interface of other languages such as Visual studio made me tempted to use them.

  <button class="accordion">Topo-Tool</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p> <strong>Topo-Tool</strong> is a software for a topometric calculations which are necessary for a surveyor to process the data collected in a field by GPS or Total station measurements. It contains various 
       modules, from a simple bearing and distance calculation or angle conversion to complex network adjustment using a least square adjustment method, displaying the standards deviations 
       for the adjusted component. Also it includes the transformation between different projected systems. Moreover, it contains a module which can be very useful for a 'Tree survey' which 
       can identify a double surveyed points as these cannot be seen easily on the drawing file. The simplicity of the data structure of the input file using a Notepad makes it user-friendly.
       It supports different angle units, so no need to pre-process angles measurments.In addition. Examples are included to facilitate it use by following the input data format.
       The previous version in French was published at <a href="https://www.topographie.net/logiciels/fiche.php?GID=26">Topo-Tool-V1</a>. This version can be downloaded via :

  <button class="accordion">VRD-Widget</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>The abbeviation VRD translates to English as 'Roads and Miscellaneous networks'. It can be used in the construction of access roads, the implementation of water supplies, electricity and telecommunications networks.
      <strong> VRD-Widget</strong> is a tool for a calculation of  the volume of 'fill & cut' in road design. Based on a method using a trapezoidal integral rule. For the mesh network for water 
      supply, the itteratif  " Hardy & Cross" method is used for its calculation, where example and explanation sheet are provided. For the waste water network, where a domestic waste water is 
      neglected, the calculation takes only rain fall water into consideration. In addition 2 modules for a calculation of circular and trapezoidal pipeline are present.This program was published in French
      at <a href="https://www.topographie.net/logiciels/fiche.php?GID=29">VRD-Widget</a> . Alternatively, it can be downloaded via the link below.

  <button class="accordion">Auscult</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p> <strong> Auscult</strong>: is a program dedicated for dam stability check,in other words 'dam monitoring'. It is based on three components which are triangulation and levelling networks
    adjustment and "Helmert's" transformation which a similarity plan ( translation, rotation and scale). This one is used to determine stable pilars which will be considered as fixed points
    in a triangulation adjustment. In practice, we would consider a pilar as stable if it's displacement relatively to the initial measure is <= 3 mm for earth dam and <= 2 mm for concrete dam.
    The calculation is based on an itteratif process where in each itteration the data file is replaced by eliminating the pilar showing the largest displacement. The networks adjustments are based
    on the least square method where the sum of the squared errors multiplied by the weight of the observations are minimised.

   <p>Prior to running these programs, Microsoft Frame work needs to be installed in your machine.Otherwise it can be downloaded from Microsoft official website. Same thing for Microsoft Power Pack.
    Please note, downloading an executable file is usually flagged up by the anti-virus or web browser's one.However these programs are garanteed free of virus therefore it is safe to download them if you wish. </p>

      <h4> HP41Cv Calculator</h4>

       <p>The HP-41 scientific & engineering calculator was produced from 1979 to 1990, for more than 10 years, 
        brilliantly holding its own against the Basic programmable pocket computers that marked this era.
        It had significantly more memory than its predecessor HP-67, a powerful proprietary programming language.
         Also alphanumeric capabilities, enhanced by the 14-segment digit display, instantly recognisable, 
         and four slots to accommodate additional modules.The HP-41 had its optional printer. 
         It was also possible to obtain a magnetic card reader, or a barcode reader for quick entry of 
         programs published in this form. The cherry on the cake: networking several machines and 
         peripherals was possible, using the HP-IL peripheral, which was very expensive at the time.
          A successful concept, a high-performance, scalable machine, a relatively affordable price, 
          all well-made, at the right time.Here is a download link if you miss it ðŸ¤£ </p>
